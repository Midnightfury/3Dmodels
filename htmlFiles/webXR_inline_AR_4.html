                An office chair, or desk chair, is a type of chair that is designed for use at a desk in an office. It
                is
                usually a
                swivel chair, with a set of wheels for mobility and adjustable height. Modern office chairs typically
                use a
                single,
                distinctive load bearing leg (often called a gas lift), which is positioned underneath the chair seat.
                Near
                the floor
                this leg spreads out into several smaller feet, which are often wheeled and called casters. Office
                chairs
                were developed
                around the mid-19th century as more workers spent their shifts sitting at a desk, leading to the
                adoption of
                several
                features not found on other chairs.

                The concept of a height-adjustable, swivelling chair with castors was illustrated by the Nuremberg
                patrician
                Martin
                Löffelholz von Kolberg in his 1505 technological illuminated manuscript, the so-called Löffelholz Codex,
                on
                folio
                10r. One of the earliest known innovators to have created the modern office chair was naturalist Charles
                Darwin, who
                put wheels on the chair in his study so he could get to his specimens more quickly

                With the advent of rail transport in the mid-19th century, businesses began to expand beyond the
                traditional
                model of a
                family business with little emphasis on administration. The additional administrative staff was required
                to
                keep up with
                orders, bookkeeping, and correspondence as businesses expanded their service areas. While office work
                was
                expanding, an
                awareness of office environments, technology, and equipment became part of the cultural focus on
                increasing
                productivity. This awareness gave rise to chairs designed specifically for these new administrative
                employees: office
                chairs. This caught the attention of Otto von Bismarck, who is credited with popularizing the office
                chair
                by
                distributing them throughout parliament during his time in office. American inventor Thomas E. Warren
                (b.
                1808),
                designed the Centripetal Spring Armchair in 1849 which was produced by the American Chair Company in
                Troy,
                New York.
                It was first presented at the 1851 Great Exhibition in London. It was only around 1850 when a group of
                engineers in
                the United States began to investigate how chairs could improve health and relaxation by stressing
                posture
                and movement.
            </p>

                The office chair was strategically designed to increase the productivity of clerical employees by making
                it
                possible for
                them to remain sitting at their desks for long periods of time. A swiveling chair with casters allowed
                employees to
                remain sitting and yet reach a number of locations within their work area, eliminating the time and
                energy
                expended in
                standing. The wooden saddle seat was designed to fit and support the body of a sitting employee, and the
                slatted back
                and armrests provided additional support to increase the employee’s comfort. Like modern chairs, many of
                these models
                were somewhat adjustable to provide the maximum comfort and thus the maximum working time.
